/*CREDITS:
All credits to Stefan Kolarov (Stephen Kolaroff) for work on JEPlite...the shrunk JEP parser
Thanks to Nathan Funk (JEP project -- also on Sourceforge) for all of his assistance

David Newman gets credit for the work (still in its infancy) of code beautification...
	If it looks like shit, he hasn't gotten to it yet...

Also...a great big thanks to:
Stephen Blackheath, of the Grapevine project (also on Sourceforge), 
For all of his encouragement, cheering, and basic 'being a sounding board' style of help...
it was amazing to have such a valuable friend around when I needed it most..
Recently, his help with a performance drag issue, and his overall assurances that the project is worthwhile, have come when I needed them to..and I am so very grateful.
..plus.. his early work on "noughts and crosses" (tic-tac-toe) showed me what the language might be lacking... and allowed me to make it both more complex and simple simultaneously...

To Danny Gordon,
Future partner, future developer, great sound-board, and good friend.
Thanks

Credits to Yoann Jagoury for working on some bottlenecks...  

William Alber, for the modified methods using StringBuffer (so I didn't have to do it myself), some code refactoring, and logic-checking.. as well as his interest in potentially becoming a developer on future interpreters for the language. 
He has also made great strides in pulling implementation out of the Statement Processor's run() method... which will be invaluable in the future 'preprocessor'-mode Dustyscript work.
